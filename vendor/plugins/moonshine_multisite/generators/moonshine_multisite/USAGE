Description:
    Generate a sample moonshine multisite manifest for your Rails Application

Example:
    ./script/generate moonshine_multisite <host_identifier> <host_identifier> 
                                      [ <att1=v1> ... ]

Where <host_identifier> is the short host key in moonshine_multisite.yml

You can override values in moonshine_multisite.yml by passing them on the command
line.

    This will create:
        app/manifests
        app/manifests/application_manifest.rb
        app/manifests/templates
        app/manifests/templates/passenger.vhost.erb
        app/manifests/templates/README
        config/moonshine.yml
        config/deploy
        config/deploy/<host_identifier>
        config/deploy/<host_identifier>/moonshine.yml
        config/deploy/<host_identifier>/prod.rb
        config/deploy/<host_identifier>/prod_moonshine.yml
        config/deploy/<host_identifier>/staging.rb
        config/deploy/<host_identifier>/staging_moonshine.yml
        config/deploy/<host_identifier>/dev.rb
        config/deploy/<host_identifier>/dev_moonshine.yml
        config/deploy.rb
