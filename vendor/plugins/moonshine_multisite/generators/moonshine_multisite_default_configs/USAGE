Description:
    Generate database.<app>.<stage>.yml defaults in app/manifests/templates/database_configs/(public|private) for all server, app and stage combinations.
    
    Usage: moonshine_multisite_default_configs <app> [private]

    Private is optional: without it, the database name will be constructed as
    <server>.<app>.<stage>, ex c4c.pat.dev.  with it, the database name is taken
    from moonshine_multisite's lookup [:servers][:db_names][app][stage]

Example:
    ./script/generate moonshine_multisite_default_configs pat private

    This will create:
        app/manifests/application_manifest.rb
